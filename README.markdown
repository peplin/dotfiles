# peplin does holman's dotfiles

Test

## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles - a customizer version of holman's. They are also
prejudiced, but towards: Linux, zsh, Python, Django, git, vim.

## dependencies

- hub

## install

- `git clone git://github.com/holman/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `script/bootstrap`

The will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though.

## thanks

I forked [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman)'s
[dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles), as I appreciate his respect of
modularity.
